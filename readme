Programmed in pure Java. The chess program simulates all possible moves for a player, showing only the valid moves he or she can make. This is especially apparent when a player is in check, as the number of valid moves drops to two or three. Allows players to undo or redo moves all the way back to the start of the match, and automates this process by having an 'instant-replay' mode that plays back the entire match. Allows single player play against a rudimentary AI opponent. En Passant, castling, and piece promotion is programmed in.
